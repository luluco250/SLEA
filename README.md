# SLEA
Skip Launcher &amp; ENB Auto

A small tool that allows you to skip launchers and automate the opening and closing of an ENB Injector.
Both functions are modular, you can use any alone or both at the same time.

The latest binary can be found in the __Build__ directory.
A helper setup script can be found in the __Helper__ directory.

Instructions for automatic setup:

1.	Copy/extract SLEA.exe and SLEA_Helper.bat to the game directory.

2.	Run SLEA_Helper.bat and follow the on-screen instructions.

3.	If you setup SLEA to replace the game launcher (a backup is made), you can play the game directly with the "new" launcher (which is SLEA renamed as the game's original launcher).

4.	Otherwise, you can run your game through SLEA.exe, to automate the opening and closing of the specified ENB Injector.


Instructions for manual setup:

1.	Copy/extract SLEA.exe to the game directory.

2.	Run SLEA.exe once, it'll create a new configuration file and open it for you.

3.	Follow the instructions on the file and fill it with the configuration desired.

4.	If you setup SLEA to replace the game launcher (a backup is made), you can play the game directly with the "new" launcher (which is SLEA renamed as the game's original launcher).

5.	Otherwise, you can run your game through SLEA.exe, to automate the opening and closing of the specified ENB Injector.

And that should be it!
I hope you enjoy this little tool I came up with!
