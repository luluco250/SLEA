#Skip-Launcher and ENBAuto

This small program allows you to:
- Launch an executable, this way you can replace game launchers (like those from Bethesda games) to skip them.
- Automatically open and close ENBInjector (or any other executable) with a game.

For example, let's say you have Fallout New Vegas installed on a Nvidia Optimus laptop and you can't use the wrapper/dll version of ENB.

You can have SLEA automatically run and close ENBInjector for you. 

Not only that, you can also replace the launcher to completely skip it!

A template configuration file is included, but SLEA will automatically generate one if one doesn't exist in the same directory.
